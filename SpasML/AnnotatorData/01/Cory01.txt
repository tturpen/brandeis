They , too , stared at him .
It was coming toward him .
Then there was another sound .
He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch .
He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water .
He still had three miles to go .
He had to reach Admassy's place .
And then he heard them .
And now he saw them .
He did not leave the middle of the road .
He was going to make it , he told himself .
That is , maybe not too much of a lady .
I was watching for numbers .
I got a quick look at their faces as we went past .
They've got no official standing on this side of the Bay .
Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address .
I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts .
After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled .
They were in the center of the lobby now .
He couldn't feel any .
Roberts appeared to be dead ;
It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do .
They would have to .
One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet .
Walking away on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry .
He could feel it on his face and in his hair .
He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping .
Then he went back for Roberts .
He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep .
It wasn't like carrying the suitcase .
He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out .
Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge .
The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor .
He made his way back to the Jeep .
He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room .
Well , I do remember one .
I can look it up .
He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving .
Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half .
He pulled it open .
