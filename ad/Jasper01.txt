As for that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again .
I walked over to him .
I followed him out through the lobby to the street .
I walked with him back to the entrance .
He came out alone .
I wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car .
I kept trying to get him to take my money .
She knew where to come .
Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door .
The gun followed her .
It was getting light .
She had cried a little because she was frightened .
When she was finished she pushed it back .
Now he looked at her .
Her mother and father , for instance .
He inserted the car key in the lock .
The big car sprang away from the curb like something alive .
He had driven the car that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place .
He looked straight at Marty .
He thought he saw a pale face at a window .
They , too , stared at him .
It was coming toward him .
Then there was another sound .
He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch .
He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water .
He still had three miles to go .
He had to reach Admassy's place .
And then he heard them .
And now he saw them .
He did not leave the middle of the road .
He was going to make it , he told himself .
That is , maybe not too much of a lady .
I was watching for numbers .
I got a quick look at their faces as we went past .
They've got no official standing on this side of the Bay .
Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address .
I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts .
After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled .
They were in the center of the lobby now .
He couldn't feel any .
